### Thoughts

I copy the articles into ``xxx.docx`` when I study English and mark the words I don't know. Extract the words into the ``xxx.txt`` file and recite them with the "No Memorized Words App".  

**Currently this program will help me to extract the marked words**

### TODO

- [ ] format RGB vlaue

### 🦄

- I will improve according to their own needs, if you have good ideas welcome to discuss😇
